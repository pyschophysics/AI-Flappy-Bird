With this project, I am trying to do an AI Flappy Bird using the neat module. NEAT stands for: Non-exercise activity thermogenesis and what it does it uses genomes to learn a certain task/technique. I will also attach images needed for the project. So what I tried doing is training a certain population using natural selection in the neat Module in order to train the flappy bird to play one it's own. In fact, this neural network is so strong that it's able to master the game of flappy bird with a population size of only 20.
